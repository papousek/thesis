\chapter{Introduction}
Using of computers and other electronic devices becomes more and more common in
the educational process. This allows

\begin{itemize}
	\item	wide usage of computers $\rightarrow$ help teachers with routine tasks
				and provide personalized approach for students;
	\item	teacher's aspect vs. student's aspect;
	\item	providing content, complex exercises vs. practicing atomic tasks;
	\item	domains where you need to learn facts -- vocabulary, anatomy, \ldots;
	\item	fixed amount of time at school vs. online environment with a lot of
				possible activities and high fluctuation;
	\item	the system providing practice needs to attract and keep the attention
				of users and spend the given amount of time in the most effective way
				with respect to learning;
	\item	different users have different background - not only knowledge, but
				also the motivation of the practice can differ (vs. school where the
				motivation is $\pm$ the same);
	\item	systems motivating users to stay active $\neq$ systems effective in
				learning;
	\item	there is no obvious technique for practicing in online environment;
	\item	to build a good adaptive you need at least:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	a good model describing the user's knowledge;
			\item	good strategy for practicing -- may differ for different types of
						users (some users want to learn for the tommorrow exam, some users want to
						learn in long term);
		\end{itemize}
	\item	we can't design a good strategy for practice when we can not measure
				its impact on the user's motivation to practice and the effectivenes for
				learning -- big methodological issue in online environment;
	\item	when we build a widely used system for practice
\end{itemize}

\chapter{State of the Art}

\section{Memory and Models}

\begin{itemize}
	\item spacing effect~\cite{ostrow2015blocking,maass2015how,kornell2008learning,kornell2010spacing}
	\item flashcards (\textbf{TODO})~\cite{kornell2014focusing,bjork2013self,kornell2008optimising,kornell2009optimising}
	\item distractors~\cite{little2015optimizing}
	\item learning and forgetting curves~\cite{streeter2015mixture}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item ~
		\end{itemize}
	\item recall vs. recognition
	\item BKT, IRT, \ldots
\end{itemize}

\section{Practice Control}

\begin{itemize}
	\item over-practice
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Trying to minimize a number of under-practiced and over-practiced attempts.
			\item In \cite{cen2007over} more than 50\% of practices detected as
				over-practiced. Some hard problems had less practices then the easiest
				one.
			\item Master-threshold can be viewed as a parameter that controls the
				relative frequency of under-practiced (FP) and over-practiced (FN)
				attempts~\cite{fancsali2013optimal}.
			\item There is some low acceptable number of attempts after the knowledge
				is acquired - \textbf{lag}~\cite{fancsali2013optimal}.
			\item Typical master-threshold is set to $P(L) > 0.95$.
		\end{itemize}
	\item zone of proximal development~\cite{lee2005signifying}
	\item inner vs. outer loop~\cite{koedinger2013new}
	\item theories of intrinsic motivation~\cite{habgood2011motivating}
	\item instructional design methodologes~\cite{luckin2001designing}
\end{itemize}

\section{Systems}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Cerego
	\item Duolingo~\cite{von2013duolingo, garcia2013learning}
	\item Fact and Concept Training~\cite{pavlik2007fact,pavlik2008using}
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item only student model and its accuracy~\cite{pelanek2014brief}
	\item saved time for getting mastery~\cite{yudelson2015small}
	\item combination of historical data and simulation~\cite{gonzalez2015your}
	\item exploring the interaction loop using synthetic data~\cite{niznan2015exploring}
	\item learning vs. time spent in a system~\cite{lomas2013optimizing, monterrat2015player},
	\item online multivariate (AB) testing~\cite{lomas2013optimizing,liu2014towards,stamper2012rise}
	\item multi-armed bandits~\cite{liu2014trading,lopes2015multi}
	\item recommender systems: model performance vs. impact~\cite{cremonesi2010performance}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Aims of the Thesis}

The main aim of the thesis is to design and evaluate several techniques of
learning factographical knowledge via practice of multiple choice questions in
online environment. Although the work is focused on the practice of geography,
the found results will be easily appliable to other similar domains like
vocabulary.

\begin{itemize}
	\item canary deployment in the context of ITS
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
	\item deploy a system used for \url{http://slepemapy.cz} with data for
		anatomy to get more historical data about one user;
	\item propose a methodology to evaluate the impact of adaptive practice on
		student's learning in online environment;
	\item implement the proposed methodology within a system for adaptive
		practice of geography and anatomy;
	\item design and implement a model of forgetting (cooperating with model for
		estimation of prior knowledge)
	\item find optimal parameters of adaptive practice with respect to motivation
		and learning (it can differ for different groups of users)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item target difficulty;
			\item spacing
			\item choice of distractors
			\item recall vs. recognition
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
