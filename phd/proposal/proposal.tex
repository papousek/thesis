\chapter{Introduction}

Using computers and other electronic devices becomes more and mo\-re common in
every day life, so it is natural to use them also in a domain of education. We
can look at it with two different viewpoints. In the first case we want to help
a teacher to spend less time doing routine tasks and more time with students,
to prepare good teaching materials, to effectively find out what students
know and what they do not know, and so on. In the second case we help
a student directly. We deal with personalized systems providing adaptive
content, e.g. guiding students in situations when the they lag behind
or introduce new challenges when they are able to solve them. We assume
students interact with these systems with minimal assistence of teachers.

\section{Computerized Adaptive Practice}

Although the first viewpoint is important we focus on the second one and we are
ainly interested in the content where students actively solve presented tasks,
i.e. \emph{computerized adaptive practice}~\cite{klinkenberg2011computer}.
According to~\cite{vanlehn2006behavior} the practice conists of two loops. The
outer loop describes the selection of the task to solve and the inner one
describes a process of solution within one complex multi-step task. In the
following work we deal with memorizing facts, e.g. vocabulary, location of
countries in geography or terms in anatomy. The tasks can be understood as
atomic without any intermidiate steps, so the inner loop is not so important
for us. The practice as we understand it consists of answering of
multiple-choice and open-ended questions, interleaved with a~feedback on the
correctness.

Based on the recent research~\cite{bjork2013self} self-testing is a~good
strategy that may boost student's performance. On the other side people make
mistakes during the practice, which makes it less effective. They overestimate
their knowledge and this overconfidence leads to worse choice of tasks for
practice~\cite{bjork2013self,kornell2008optimising}. The second interseting
facts is that although the repetition seems to be good for memorizing, it is
not so common since high performers may not need it and low performers may not
be motivated to use it~\cite{bjork2013self}. This implies that a well-designed
systems for computerized adaptive practice can be really helpful in this area.
Ideally this kind of systems should be online to be available to a large number
of users.

In online environment we deal with different categories of users. It is natural
these systems are used by students from schools, sometimes even at schools for
fixed amount of time. On the other side they are also open to non-school users
willing to improve their knowledge in their free time. Having diverse set of
users means these users have varied background, motivation and prior knowledge.
Some users may want to learn for the tommorrow exam, some users want to learn
in long term. This is in the opposite to classical schools where these factors
do not differ much for different students within one classroom. We have to be
sure the system providing the practice attract and keep the attention of all
kinds of users and spend the given amount of time in the most effective way
with respect to learning.  This can be a bit difficult, because a strategy
motivating users to stay active may be different from a strategy making the
practice effective in learning.

To provide adaptivity we need to build a~sufficient model describing user's
knowledge including prior knowledge, learning, forgetting and other. We also
need to design good strategy for practicing, which may differ for different
types of users. Since there is no obvious technique for practicing in online
environment, we need to be able to collect data about user's activity and
evaluate it. We can not design a~good strategy for practice when we are not
able to measure its impact on user's motivation and its effectivenes in
learning. This turns out to be a big methodological issues in online
environment.

The importance of the described topic is also supported by the rise of several
commercial systems in this area. These systems provide practice of individual
terms within several domains, like~\url{www.memrise.com} and
\url{www.cerego.com}, or teach users foreign language in a more complex way,
like~\url{www.duolingo.com}~\cite{garcia2013learning}, where users practice the foreign language by
translating sentences (both writing and speaking). Unfortunately, with some
exceptions~\cite{streeter2015mixture}, it is hard to find any insight how these
systems work.

\chapter{State of the Art}

Development a fully adaptive system providing a practice of facts requires
insights from a few from the first viewpoint different areas. This chapter
describes state of the art in these areas starting from psychology and
cognitive science to student modelling, controlling the practice itself,
evaluation and concrete systems.

\section{Memory and Learning of Facts}
\label{section:models}

The common way to learn facts whether online or offline is using
flashcards~\cite{kornell2008optimising}. A flashcard has two sides, the first
side represents a given term we want to learn and the second one its
explanation, e.g. translation or image describing it.  During one practice
session a sequence of flashcards is presented, so firstly we look at one side
trying to say what is on the second side and then check whether our answer is
correct. This really simple setup has a few parameters needed to be considered:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item How many flashcards should be available in one practice session?
	\item What is their optimal order?
	\item Should we drop some flashcards out of the practice if we think we already know it?
	\item Should we gradually add flashcards with new terms and how?
	\item How many time should we repeat the practice?
	\item What is the optimal time space between individual presentations of one flashcard?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Spacing Effect}
\label{section:spacing_effect}
ll of the mentioned questions relate to the \emph{spacing
effect} and \emph{forgetting curves} originally discovered by Hermann
Ebbinghaus~\cite{ebbinghaus1885spacing}~(as cited
in~\cite{pavlik2005practice}). When the terms are practiced with more time
space between individual presentations, it reduces our performance during the
practice itself, but in long term it has a positive impact on our
learning~\cite{maass2015how, kornell2009optimising}. This is in the opposite of
usual preparation of students before exams when they prefer \emph{massed
repetition} (also known as \emph{cramming}), intensive work to absorb large
volume of knowledge in short time period.

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{figure/forgetting_curves}
		\caption{Forgetting curve introduced by Ebbinghaus is given by a
			formula $R = e^{-\frac{t}{S}}$, where $R$ stands for the memory retention, $t$
			for the time and $S$ for the relative strength of memory. Ebbinghaus
			found realized that when the information is reminded again, it strengthens
			not only the memory, but also also reduces the forgetting rate. This phenomenon
			is called \emph{overlearning}.
			\textbf{TODO}}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

In the context of computerized adaptive practice we should look at the spacing
effect from two different points of view. In the first case we want to control
it within one session. Here we have full control over it and we work with
seconds, minutes or hours (maximally). With a fixed number of items for
practice we regulate the spacing by modifying the sequence of practiced items,
e.g. more blocking or iterleaving version of
practice~\cite{ostrow2015blocking}, with variable set of items we can also
decide which items do not have to be practiced
anymore~\cite{kornell2008optimising} or which new items can be included.
Current research shows that in this specific case lies great potential, because
the sequencing has a big impact of the learning
performance~\cite{ostrow2015blocking} and people are not able effectively judge
which items are already learned~\cite{kornell2008optimising} and which ones
should be practiced~\cite{kornell2014focusing}.

In the second case we plan the practice over more
sessions~\cite{kang2014retrieval}. Ideally a system should decide when the
session starts and when it ends. Of course this decision is made by a user,
not by a system. We can only motivate users to practice regularly, e.g. every
day similarly how it is done by Duolingo (a system for learning
languages)~\cite{garcia2013learning}. This regularity allows us to strengthen
knowledge of already learned items and itroduce new ones.

\subsection{Models Overview}

\paragraph*{Rasch Model} is known as the one-parameter logistic model in item
response theory (\textbf{TODO: CITE}). It assumes the student's knowledge about
an item is constant and can be expressed as a skill parameters $\theta$. Also
each item is assigned by a difficulty parameter $b$. Having these parameters
the probability of correct answer is given by the logistic function:

\begin{align}
P(correct|\theta,b) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\theta - b)}}
\end{align}

Parameters of this model are usually estimated from data using the joint
maximum likelihood estimation~\cite{de2008theory}. In online environment it is
useful to update the parameters on the fly. For this purpose we can inspire by
Elo rating system~\cite{elo1978rating} originally devised for chess rating and
look at a student's answer on an item as match between the student and
the item~\cite{papousek2014adaptive}. If our estimation is based only on the
first interactions between students and items, the algorithm works for constant
skills and difficulties, although the original Elo system assumes learning (changing skill).

\paragraph*{Bayesian Knowledge Tracing} is usually used model for
learning~\cite{van2013properties}. It models student's knowledge in a hidden
Markov model as a binary latent variable (either learned or unlearned). The model
has four parameters: probability the given is initially learned, probability of
learning based on one step, probability of wrong answer when the skill is
learned (slip), and probability of correct answer when the skill is not learned
(guess). Skill estimation is updated using a Bayes rule using observed answer.
Several extensionis of this model can be found, e.g.
forgetting~\cite{qiu2010does} or slightly different point of view using mixture
of learning curves~\cite{streeter2015mixture}.

\paragraph*{Performance Factor Analysis} is another logistic
model~\cite{pavlik2009performance}, but in contrast with the Rasch model it
handles learning. The skill is represented as a linear combination of the
item's difficulty ($\beta$) and the number of past success ($s$) and failures
($f$) of the given student.

\begin{align}
P(correct|\beta,s, f) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta + \gamma s + \delta f)}}
\end{align}

where $\gamma$ stands for the change of the skill associated with correct
answer and $\delta$ stands for the same in case of incorrect answer.

\bigskip

\noindent
In many areas of learning of facts people enter the tutoring system with varied
prior knowledge, e.g. vocabulary or geography. A system needs to quickly assess
what a user knows to be able to adaptively provide appropriate content. This
feature is often missing in several systems and the user is forced to go through
a lot of useless content. Our recent work~\cite{papousek2014adaptive} simlarly
to~\cite{khajah2014integrating} combines a model assuming a constant skill with
another one for learning to handle this phenomenon.  But this should go even
further and models should also provide different
learning~\cite{pelanek2015modeling} and forgetting rate for different items.
A model using a mixture of individual learning curves implememted within
Duolingo~\cite{streeter2015mixture} already covers some of these aspects, but
they do not give much attention to prior knowledge and ignore spacing effect.
On the other side studies dealing with spacing effect are usually based on
observations in laboratory with artifical conditions, e.g.  people learn
generally uknown terms to prevent prior knowledge~\cite{kang2014retrieval} or
there is no corrective-feedback given during retriaval
practice~\cite{landauer1978optimum}~(as cited in~\cite{kang2014retrieval}) and
it is questionable how all their insights will work within an online system.

\section{Practice Control}
\label{section:practice_control}

As we already presented in the previous sections we focus on \emph{outer loop}
of user's practice~\cite{vanlehn2006behavior}, mainly within one session, that
is sequencing of items presented to a user. The considered area of learning
of facts doesn't provide sufficiently complex tasks to deal with \emph{inner
loop} (e.g. hints)~\cite{vanlehn2006behavior} and we think it is enough. The
practice itself consists of a sequence of multiple-choice and open-ended
questions and we have to decide not only which item should be practiced, but
also whether and how many options the question should have and in case of
multiple-choice questions which items should be used as distractors. Sequencing
should also take into account spacing effect described in
section~\ref{section:spacing_effect}.

\subsection{Sequencing}

By seqencing the items presented to a user for practice we balance between two
states: \emph{over-practice} and \emph{under-practice}. In the first case we
practice an already learned item and we waste user's time. In the second one we
stop practicing an item which is not learned yet and we will not give her a
chance learn it completely. When a system tries to avoid over-practiced
attempts, there is high chance that under-practice increases and vice versa.
How this phenomenon is importent is presented in a study~\cite{cen2007over}
where its authors reported that analysing historical data they detected more
than $50\%$ out of practice attempts as over-practiced.

In a lot of used systems a general approach for sequencing the items for
practice is based on labelling from an expert. The experts defines knowledge
components for the given domain and prerequisites among them. There are
techniques helping the ex\-perts~\cite{niznan2014using} or completely replace
them by a computer~\cite{boros2013automatic}. However, these techniques are
rarely used. Each component is a set of items and generally one item can be
included within more components. We can practice items belonging to one
component as long as the given user has mastered its prerequisites, but not the
component itself. This edge of knowledge is also known as the \emph{zone of
proximal development}~\cite{lee2005signifying}.

The mastery is detected by a model predicting user's performance and we say
that the user masters the knowledge component when the predicted probability
the user learned the component exceeds the \emph{mastery threshold} which is
usually set to~$95\%$. Mastery threshold can be viewed as parameter controlling
the relative frequency of under-practiced and over-practiced
attempts~\cite{fancsali2013optimal}. Since our model needs data about a user
to make estimation, there is some low acceptable number of attempts after the
enowledge is acquired. This \emph{lag} studied in more detail
in~\cite{fancsali2013optimal}, but the study is limited for \emph{Bayesian
knowledge tracing} only. Another \emph{when-to-stop} policy is based on the
expected improvement~\cite{rollinson2015predictive}. When the system expects
the improvement below a given threshold in some knowledge component, it stops
practicing it. Low expected improvement indicates already mastered domain or
the user is unable to master it.

Similar approach is presented in~\cite{lopes2015multi}. It relies
on~\emph{multi-armed bandits}, a technique generally being able to explore
space of different parameters or strategies with respect to a given scoring
function. The authors define a structure of activites and pre-conditions
analogical to knowledge components and prerequisites and introduce two
algorithms optimizing user's learning. The first one is independent on any
model estimating user's performance, the second one uses it. Both of them take
information from experts and measure user's learning online based on progress
of the user's performance. The exact measure is defined as:

\begin{align}
	r = \sum^{t}_{k = t - \frac{d}{2}} \frac{C_k}{\frac{d}{2}} - \sum^{t - \frac{d}{2}}_{k = t - d} \frac{C_k}{d - \frac{d}{2}}
\end{align}

where $C_k = 1$ if the exercise at time $k$ was solved correctly. At time $t$,
the measure compares the success of the last $\frac{d}{2}$ samples with the
$\frac{d}{2}$ previous samples. Learning can estimated by this way thanks to
the fact, the system measures and improves the user's performance at the same
time. We show in section~\ref{section:evaluation} this is not always true in
some kind of systems.

In some cases the approach using a graph of prerequisites makes sense, e.g.
in algebra we have a strong structure of prerequisites among the knowledge
components (addition and multiplication) and the choice of an item (exercise)
from the knowledge component is not so important, if we know that all
prerequisites for the given component are mastered. On the other hand in case
of a system for learning of vocabulary, individual items are independent, so we
have one item per knowledge component. Of course we can build a structure of
categories and prerequisites, but they represent a recommended study plan
rather than necessity. When a user enters the system, she can theoretically
start practicing anything.

In~\cite{papousek2014adaptive} and~\cite{papousek2015impact} we present an
approach mainly based on target difficulty. We assume we have already
estimation of user's performance for each item available in our system,
together with other descriptive information like number of interactions with
the given item, last time when the user interacted with it and so on. Since the
estimation is based only on historical data we do not need any expert's input.
On the other side we are fully dependent on the choice of target difficulty and
although there are studies about it~\cite{lomas2013optimizing,
lomas2014optimizing,jansen2013influence,papousek2015impact}, further research
has to be done in this area. Several systems has this parameter set
arbitrarily, e.g.  75\% chance of correct
answer~\cite{klinkenberg2011computer}.

As we present in section~\ref{section:spacing_effect}, learning of facts highly
releates to time and spacing effect. From this point of view the  schedule of
practice was already studied~\cite{pavlik2008schedule}, but in different
context, which is in laboratory with low number of items and without any prior
knowledge. Figure~\ref{figure:practice_progress} shows how the spacing effect
relates to the content of practice and number of practiced items.

\begin{figure}

		\label{figure:practice_progress_b}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Visualization of practice with different spacing, each column
		corresponds to an item, each row represents a discrete time unit. Black
		boxes stands for practice attempts.}
	\label{figure:practice_progress}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Questions}

Assume we have already picked an item for practice which correspons to a
flashcard with two sides $A$ and $B$. We must specify a direction of the final
question (whether we ask for the side $A$ or $B$), e.g. in case of vocabulary
the first direction leads to an ability of understanding to foreign language
and the second one to an ability of expressing of ideas in it. In both ways we
want to achieve so-called \emph{cued recall}~(\textbf{TODO: cite}).

Once we select a direction we must decide whether the question will be
open-ended or how many options it will have. Using the options we allow a user
to guess the correct answer, so we make the question easier.
Figure~\ref{figure:options_vs_spacing} shows how the number of options relates
to difficulty of the final question together with spacing which is controlled
by sequencing. If our only goal is to make the difficulty of user's practice
appropriate, it is not clear which combination of spacing and number of options
we should use.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{figure/options_vs_spacing}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Graph illustrating how difficulty depends on spacing and number of
		options. Darker background color means more difficult practice.}
	\label{figure:options_vs_spacing}
\end{figure}

The next issue is how exactly should be the options themselves be chosen. We
assume too easy options made the guess probability so high, a user wouldn't be
motivated to learn anything. The impact of competitivness of options has been
studied in~\cite{little2015optimizing}. The study contains two experiments
where the first one does not include feedback about the correctness of user's
answer, so its results can be hardly applied within an application where the
feedback is present. And based on the second experiment where the feedback was
included, competitive options seem to be the better choice. However the
experiment was very limited, so this phenomenon is worth further investigation.

The second aspect related to the competitivness of the options is repeating the
same mistakes. Authors in~\cite{marsh2007memorial} describe experiments where
wrong answer in the final test are correlated to wrong answers within a
preparation phase where multiple-choice question were used. These observation
should be definitely taken into account when the options are built within an
adaptive system for practice.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{section:evaluation}

Any effort to improve any kind of intelligent tutoring system would be useless
if we were not able to measure some of its features. Design of these
adaptive systems and choice of their parameters are really difficult and then
their adaptive behavior is hard to predict, so it is crucial to be sure they
meet our expectations. Generally we want to improve user's learning, but due to
the fact the systems are often used during user's free time, we must also
ensure user's willingness to use the system. How these things can relate to each
other is studied in~\cite{lomas2013optimizing}.

Since a lot of systems collect data about user's performance and their
behaviour is based on models predicting the performance, its natural to
evaluate new models using the historical data with respect to accuracy. We can
also try to find whether the bahaviour of the system would change, if it used a
different model. The second possibility is to deploy a new feature, collect new
data and then see what has changed. This way is really expensive, because we
spend user's time for testing of our system instaed of learning something. We
also risk negative impact on users. The last way how to examine our ideas is to
use synthetic data. Generating synthetic data is cheap, there is no risk, but
we must work with a lot of assumptions which can limit us.

\subsection{Historical Data}

Typical data about user's performance contains a list of solved tasks and
binary information whether the user's solution was correct ($1$) or incorrect
($0$). A model predicting user's performance returns values from the interval
$[0, 1]$. Based on this we can fit a new model on a subset of data a test its
predictions compared to the rest of data. From the viewpoint of accuracy there
is a set of more or less appropriate metrics depending on the fact whether an
absolute or relative value of the prediction is important, which is more deeply
described in~\cite{pelanek2014brief}.  From a practical point of view the
accuracy is not the only important aspect of the predictive
model~\cite{huang2015framework}. It also gives us deeper insight into a domain.
Regarding this it is useful the given model holds some of the key assumptions,
e.g. a user's knowledge increases with each exercise or while fitting its
parameters converges to similar values regardless division of the data.

Similar area to adaptive systems for practice are recommender systems, e.g. for
books or movies. These systems also work with predictive models to serve
appropriate content to their users. There are
studies~\cite{cremonesi2010performance} how the accuracy of a model relates to
behavior of a recommender system as a whole using only historical data. It
would be nice to have the same for educational systems. Something similar is
presented in~\cite{yudelson2015small} where the authors quantify saved user's
time to get mastery in case of a better model. However it is questionable how
valuable these observations are. In an extreme case, a model predicting $100\%$
performance would be the best from this point of view, but it is not definitely
helpful.

\subsection{New Data}

Classical approach to examine the impact of the given system on the user's
behaviour is to follow the \emph{pre-test} $\rightarrow$ \emph{intervention}
$\rightarrow$ \emph{post-test} experiment design~(\textbf{TODO: cite}). Usually
the researchers has a full control over the participants, often in laboratory,
but also in online envrinment where the participants are motivated to finish
the whole experiment by money, e.g. in~\cite{maass2015how}. In test phases they
are assesed with respect to a measured property and the intervention phase they
use the system for the given amount of time. Although this approach is very
helpful and brings a lot of interesting observations, it does not scale.

In online environment we need to periodically deploy new features and
test them only on a subset of users, before we publish them
completely~\footnote{This process is also known as \emph{canary deployment}.}
.Doing this kind of online A/B testing opens new possibilities to
us~\cite{stamper2012rise}, we can collect large volume of data and make a
cycle of hypothesis testing faster. Unfortunately users in online environment
enter and quit a system anytime, so we can hardly adopt a method of
pre/post-testing. From this reason many studies are focused only on measuring
time a user spent in a system or number of
interactions~\cite{papousek2015impact,monterrat2015player}
rather than improvement in her performance.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{figure/interaction_loop}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Schema illustrating the interaction loop between student model and
		question construction~\cite{niznan2015exploring}.}
	\label{figure:interaction_loop}
\end{figure}

On the other side authors in~\cite{lomas2013optimizing} analyze both the time
and the performance via fitting learning curves on collected data, but it is
not clear whether the data are not influenced by the collection (higher error
tolerance can naturally lead to higher error rate and it does not say anything
about learning).  Our system for practicing of geography is aimed at a
predefined success rate~\cite{papousek2014adaptive}, so we can not simply use
the collected data to measure the user's performance. Although the interaction loop
shown on Figure~\ref{figure:interaction_loop} is present in many systems, it is
usually ignored.

Another interesting issue is how exactly we should perform the online
experiments to maximize the amount of retrieved information and minimize
experimental time~\cite{liu2014towards}. Here is great potential in techniques
like multi-armed bandits~\cite{liu2014trading} which can be used to
automatically optimize values for parameters of the practice over populations
of users.

\subsection{Synthetic Data}

Using simulated learners we easily generate synthetic data. The assumptions for
simulation are usually derived from real traffic. We know the ground truth, how
difficult items are, when a learner mastered a knowledge component and so on.
This allows us to investigate issues which could not be otherwise, like
detection of mastery~\cite{fancsali2013optimal}, learning
curves~\cite{fancsali2013simulated} or the interaction between a model
predicting user's performance and a system as a
whole~\cite{niznan2015exploring}. In~\cite{niznan2015exploring} we assume that
the optimal practice is given by a set of practiced items using a model with an
access to the ground truth and we compare practiced items with other models to
this one. Authors in~\cite{lopes2015multi} also use simulated learners before
the experiments with real people and state the practice should be personalized
which leads to varied practice sequencies. More diversity is in data, better
system is.

Experiments with synthetic data are limited by the assumptions we have for the
simulated learners. On the other hand, fewer assumptions we want to bring lead
to simpler experiments, e.g. in our study we did not want to assume anything
about learning, so our simulated practice does not contain repeated
interactions with the same item.

\chapter{Aims of the Thesis}
