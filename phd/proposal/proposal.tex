\chapter{Introduction}
Using of computers and other electronic devices becomes more and more common in
the educational process. This allows

\begin{itemize}
	\item	wide usage of computers $\rightarrow$ help teachers with routine tasks
				and provide personalized approach for students;
	\item	teacher's aspect vs. student's aspect;
	\item	providing content, complex exercises vs. practicing atomic tasks;
	\item	domains where you need to learn facts -- vocabulary, anatomy, \ldots;
	\item	fixed amount of time at school vs. online environment with a lot of
				possible activities and high fluctuation;
	\item	the system providing practice needs to attract and keep the attention
				of users and spend the given amount of time in the most effective way
				with respect to learning;
	\item	different users have different background - not only knowledge, but
				also the motivation of the practice can differ (vs. school where the
				motivation is $\pm$ the same);
	\item	systems motivating users to stay active $\neq$ systems effective in
				learning;
	\item	there is no obvious technique for practicing in online environment;
	\item	to build a good adaptive you need at least:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	a good model describing the user's knowledge;
			\item	good strategy for practicing -- may differ for different types of
						users (some users want to learn for the tommorrow exam, some users want to
						learn in long term);
		\end{itemize}
	\item	we can't design a good strategy for practice when we can not measure
				its impact on the user's motivation to practice and the effectivenes for
				learning -- big methodological issue in online environment;
	\item	when we build a widely used system for practice
\end{itemize}
